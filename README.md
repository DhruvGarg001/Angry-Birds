**Version:** v1.0  
**Created by:** Dhruv Garg  
**Year:** 2023

## Overview

**Angry Birds - Basic Edition** is a simple yet fun take on the popular Angry Birds game. Players must use their mouse to launch a bird from a sling to hit targets. The game focuses on quick reflexes and accurate aim. This game is a mere duplicate

## How to Play

- **Objective:** Launch birds to hit targets as accurately as possible.
- **Controls:**
  - **Mouse Drag:** Click and drag the bird on the sling to set your aim and release quickly to launch.
  - **Space Bar:** Press to reload a new bird onto the sling.
- **Quick Release:** Ensure you release the bird quickly after aiming; holding it too long will make your shots poor.

## Known Issues

- **Holding Bug:** If you hold the bird for too long, it may not function well. This will be improved in future versions for better user experience.

## Purpose

This game is a basic duplicate of the real **Angry Birds** and was created solely to display my programming skills in game development using **p5.js** and to demonstrate my understanding of basic game mechanics and physics simulation using **matter.js**.
